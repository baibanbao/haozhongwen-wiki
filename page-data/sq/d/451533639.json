You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]\n\n- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].\n\n- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].\n\n- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]].\n\n- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].\n\n- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].\n\n- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note\n\n- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any markdown parser. See [[link-reference-definitions]].\n\n- [ ] To explore all the Foam settings, press `cmd+,`, then `Extensions > Foam`\n\n- [ ] Living within VsCode, Foam can be customized in many ways! Look at the [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) for ideas!\n\n- [ ] Join the [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/e), introduce yourself and leave a message on how you found Foam and how the onboarding went :) We are always keen to do better\n\n- [ ] Take the [Foam Welcome survey](http://foambubble.github.io/welcome-survey/e)! It helps us better understand your need and how we can make Foam better and better for you :)\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n- [ ] You can create [[note-templates]] for things like book reviews, people, daily notes (coming soon), and more!\n\n## About Foam\n\nFoam doesn't do all this magic on its own, it relies on some amazing extensions.

No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate, including this theme. So we should only write standard markdown. I like `[[WikiLink]]`, but I love standard markdown more. So we should always use standard markdown link `[text](https://example.com)`, or use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions), and don't use any vendor locked-in feature. That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThis documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.\n\n1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.\n2. Press \"Use this template\" button at [foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.\n3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.\n\n   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item._\n\n4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)\n\nAfter setting up the repository, head to [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!\n\nTo learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.\n\nAnd remember that you can always join our [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!\n\n## Config\n\nSee [here](https://github.com/theowenyoung/gatsby-theme-primer-wiki#usage)\n\n## Local Preview\n\n```bash\ncd .layouts\nnpm i\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Deploy\n\nDeploy to Github Pages, see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`,\n\n## Using Foam\n\nWe've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.\n\n- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later\n- [[getting-started]] - learn how to use your Foam workspace\n- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do\n\nIn the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[getting-started]: getting-started.md \"Getting Started\"\n[inbox]: inbox.md \"Inbox\"\n[todo]: todo.md \"Todo\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/todo/","title":"Todo"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Todo\ntags:\n    - Readme\n    - Todo\n---\nYou can create todos in Foam.\n\n- [x] This is an example of a todo list item that's complete\n- [ ] This one is not completed yet\n- [ ] You can mark it completed by pressing `Option`+`C` (or `Alt`+`C`) when your cursor is on this line\n  - [ ] You can also select multiple lines and mark them all at once!\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/features/daily-notes/","title":"Daily Notes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Daily Notes\ntags:\n  - Notes\n  - Daily\n---\nDaily notes allow you to quickly create and access notes for today.\n\nTry it out, run the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command.\n\n## Shortcuts and Snippets\n\nYou can quickly open today's daily note by pressing `alt+d`.\nYou can also automatically open today's note via the `Foam â€º Open Daily Note: On Startup` setting.\n\nYou can also quickly create link to your daily notes, in the configured format, using [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).\n\nType `/today` and press `enter` to link to today's note.\nYou can also write:\n\n| Snippet      | Date          |\n| ------------ | ------------- |\n| `/tomorrow`  | tomorrow      |\n| `/yesterday` | yesterday     |\n| `/monday`    | next monday   |\n| `/+1d`       | tomorrow      |\n| `/-3d`       | 3 days ago    |\n| `/+1w`       | in a week     |\n| `/-1m`       | one month ago |\n| `/+1y`       | in one year   |\n\nYou get the idea ;)\n\n## Configuration\n\nIt's possible to customize path and heading of your daily notes, by following the [dateformat masking syntax](https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat#mask-options).\nThe following properties can be used:\n```json\n  \"foam.openDailyNote.directory\": \"journal\",\n  \"foam.openDailyNote.filenameFormat\": \"'daily-note'-yyyy-mm-dd\",\n  \"foam.openDailyNote.fileExtension\": \"mdx\",\n  \"foam.openDailyNote.titleFormat\": \"'Journal Entry, ' dddd, mmmm d\",\n```\n\nThe above configuration would create a file `journal/daily-note-2020-07-25.mdx`, with the heading `Journal Entry, Sunday, July 25`.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/features/graph-visualization/","title":"Graph Visualization"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Graph Visualization\ntags:\n  - Graph\n---\n\nFoam comes with a graph visualization of your notes.\nTo see the graph execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command.\n\n## Graph Navigation\n\nWith the graph you can:\n- highlight a node by hovering on it, to quickly see how it's connected to the rest of your notes\n- select one or more (by keeping `shift` pressed while selecting) nodes by clicking on them, to better understand the structure of your notes\n- navigate to a note by clicking on it while pressing `ctrl` or `cmd`\n- automatically center the graph on the currently edited note, to immediately see its connections\n\n## Custom Graph Styles\n\nBy default the Foam graph will use the VsCode theme, but it's possible to customize it with the `foam.graph.style` setting.\n\nA sample configuration object is provided below, you can provide as many or as little configuration as you wish:\n\n```json\n\"foam.graph.style\": {\n    \"background\": \"#202020\",\n    \"fontSize\": 12,\n    \"highlightedForeground\": \"#f9c74f\",\n    \"node\": {\n        \"note\": \"#277da1\",\n        \"placeholder\": \"#545454\",\n        \"feature\": \"green\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `note` defines the color for regular nodes\n- `placeholder` defines the color for links that don't match any existing note.
